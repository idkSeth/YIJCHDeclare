Automatically determine school days and submits the health deceleration and uploads a screenshot to Google Drive for verification.
Able to send email updates via IFTTT.
Run main.py for it to automatically determine if it needs to submit. Note that it will not submit on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays. Run websubmit.py if you just want to run the submitting script.
Currently am working to make main.py run continously, and make websubmit.py more efficient and cleaner.
